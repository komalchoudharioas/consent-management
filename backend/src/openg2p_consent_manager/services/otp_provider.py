"""Where the OTP actually comes from — selected by config, not by code.

Two providers, one interface:

``fayda`` (default)
    Fayda OTP semantics, in-process, via ``utils/fayda_otp``. A random six-digit
    code bound to ``(transactionID, individualId)``, stored only as a salted
    hash, compared in constant time. This is a port of the OAN Gen 1 mock
    (``g2p_ati_consent_mgt/utils/mock_fayda_otp_api.py``) rather than a call to
    it — see that module for why the rules live here instead of behind HTTP.

``internal``
    The generic equivalent: a random code with no Fayda framing, logged rather
    than delivered. Kept because it is the smallest thing that exercises the
    flow, and because it makes the seam visible — two implementations, no
    caller changes.

Switching is a config change. A real Fayda deployment plugs in by implementing
``issue`` and ``verify`` against its endpoint; nothing above this file moves.

Neither provider *delivers* anything. There is no SMS gateway in this stack, so
both write the code to the service log and say plainly in that line that no
message was sent.
