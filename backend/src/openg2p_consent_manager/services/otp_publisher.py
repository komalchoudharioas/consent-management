"""Publishes the issued OTP as a JSON object in an S3 bucket.

This mirrors the OAN Gen 1 / A2C arrangement, where the Odoo consent module
drops each generated OTP into the ``a2c-webhook`` bucket under ``otp/`` and a
tester reads it from there. The A2C Postman collection only ever *reads* that
bucket (both helpers are ``noauth``); the writing is done server-side, which is
what this module does for the consent screen's OTP.

The payload and the key are byte-compatible with theirs::

    otp/2026-09-17T10-43-25_2f30905a.json
    {"transactionID": "...", "otp": "869609", "individualId": "56789",
     "individualIdType": "FIN", "timestamp": "2026-09-17T10:43:25.865210"}

so a collection pointed at this bucket behaves exactly as it does against
A2C's - list the prefix, take the last key, read ``otp`` and ``transactionID``.

**This is a test harness, not a delivery channel.** Anything that can read the
bucket can read a live OTP next to the individual it belongs to, which is the
whole point when there is no SMS gateway and equally the reason it must stay
off wherever real subjects exist. It is disabled by default, gated on
``otp_publish_enabled``, and the code is the same plaintext the service log
already carries under ``otp_debug_enabled``.

Failure is never fatal: if the bucket is unreachable the OTP has still been
issued and hashed, so the flow continues and only a warning is logged. Losing
the convenience copy must not lose the request.
