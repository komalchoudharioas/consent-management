"""Fayda OTP semantics, in-process.

A port of the OAN Gen 1 mock —
``OAN_Registries/g2p_ati_consent_mgt/utils/mock_fayda_otp_api.py`` — which
stands in for Ethiopia's Fayda ID service and is shaped after MOSIP IDA. That
mock is an HTTP server the Odoo consent module calls; this is the same rules as
a library the Consent Manager calls directly.

Why in-process rather than another service:

- **State survives.** The original keeps transactions in a module-level dict, so
  a restart loses every one of them and a verify then answers
  ``404 Unknown transactionID``. Here the transaction IS the consent-request
  row, so it is as durable as the request it belongs to.
- **Nothing to deploy, nothing to reach.** No container, no port, no network
  path to get wrong, and no second place for the demo to break.
- **The code never crosses a wire.** The original returns the OTP to nobody and
  prints it to its own stdout; here it is generated, hashed and compared without
  leaving the process.

What is kept, because it is the part that matters:

- a **random six-digit** code, not a constant
- the code is bound to ``(transactionID, individualId)`` — verifying with a
  different individual is refused even when the code is right
- the masked-mobile reply shape, so a UI can say where the code went
- Fayda's own reason strings, so behaviour is recognisable against the Gen 1
  implementation

What is deliberately NOT kept: client id/secret checks, and the ``env`` /
``domainUri`` handshake. Those authenticate the *caller* of an HTTP service.
There is no wire here, so they would be theatre.

Swapping to a real Fayda means implementing the same two calls over HTTP against
the deployment's endpoint; nothing above ``otp_provider`` changes.
